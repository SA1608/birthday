    <div class="memory">The first chocolate you ever got me… I still can't forget the taste. Not because it was sweet but because it was SO bad. And somehow, that made it unforgettable.</div>

    <div class="memory">The first time you bought me a cookie… (I dont even eat em). But I still ate it. We went one floor above us, then took that little stroll outside the building, and there I was… still eating that cookie.</div>

    <div class="memory">I remember when you told me to show you my teeth. I was wearing braces. I was shy. I refused. But you still made me laugh the entire day.</div>

    <div class="memory">You made me laugh. You made my day. And you didn’t even realize it.</div>

    <div class="memory">When you used to make those dramatic Arjun Kapoor eyes… And I would copy you. And we would just sit there being stupid together.</div>

    <div class="memory">And when we kept copying each other again and again… like two kids who never wanted the moment to end.</div>
