    <div class="memory">The first time you bought me a cookie… (I don’t even eat them). But I still ate it. We went one floor above us, then took that little stroll outside the building, and there I was… still eating that cookie.</div>

    <div class="memory">I remember when you told me to show you my teeth. I was wearing braces. I was shy. I refused. But you still made me laugh the entire day.</div>

    <div class="memory">You made me laugh. You made my day. And you didn’t even realize it.</div>

    <div class="memory">When you used to make those dramatic Arjun Kapoor eyes… And I would copy you. And we would just sit there being stupid together.</div>

    <div class="memory">And when we kept copying each other again and again… like two kids who never wanted the moment to end.</div>

    <h1>Happy Birthday, my Pretty Boy 💗</h1>
    <p>
      Happy Birthday, my love! I LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH. <br>
      Thank you for all the memories, for the laughter, the sweetness, and even the bad chocolate. <br>
      I’m so proud of you, more than words can express, and you always make my day better just by thinking about you. <br>
      I love everything about you, your mind, your body, your soul, your eyes, your heart, and of course your smile. <br>
      I will always be here for you, maybe not always right next to you, but just a call or a text away. <br>
      I don’t know what I did to deserve someone as amazing as you, but I feel so lucky to have you in my life. <br>
      I never knew how much someone could mean to me until you came into my life. <br>
      You are my everything, and I hope this birthday is the best one ever because you deserve all the happiness and success in the world. <br>
      I love you so much, and I can’t wait to celebrate many more birthdays with you in the future. <br>
      I love you more than words can express, and I will always be here for you no matter what. <br>
      Happy Birthday, my darling, you are my everything and I am so grateful to have you in my life. <br>
      JazakAllah, thank you for being you. 💋
